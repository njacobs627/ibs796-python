In the event I mention \nPython 3.5\n, I will explicitly state \nPython3\n. For those interested in the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, please see the following: \nPython 2 or Python 3\n\n\nInstalling Python\n\n\nOSX \n Linux\n\n\nYou're in luck! In all likelihood Python is already installed. To confirm this open up a terminal and type \npython --version\n\n\n$ python --version\nPython 2.7.11\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10\n\n\nIf you are using Windows 10, you may be in luck.
