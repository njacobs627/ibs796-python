It was originally developed by Bell Labs in 1970. Fast forward a few decades, it is the basis for Apple's OS X and the many flavors of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions). Even Microsoft has begun to implement it into their latest Windows 10 versions via [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
