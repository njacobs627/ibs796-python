# Welcome To IBS796!
This GitHub Page will act as the central resource for our *IBS796 - Advanced Python Programming in Bioinformatics* course. Henceforth, we can just call it our Python course! Everything covered in lecture will likely end up here, only in more details.

## About IBS796
IBS796, *the Python course*, is a course that has been brewing for the last few years. Really since the previous Fall 2013 programming course taught by James Taylor and Tim Read. The goal of this course is to introduce students to microbial genomics via Python. We will spend a few weeks getting everyone up to speed on their Python skills. Afterwards, we will dive into full fledged microbial genomic data analysis! It is our hope that upon completion of this course, you will be able to programmatically answer your scientific questions.

## Course Time and Location
We will meet each Monday from 9:30-11:30AM in CNR5001.

## Requirements For IBS796
You will need the following:

1. A laptop (with admin privileges)
2. Python 2.7
3. A GitHub account
